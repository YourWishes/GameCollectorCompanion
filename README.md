# GameCollectorCompanion
Simple app idea that I want to use, a simple Game Collector Companion.

# Notes
App is still in development, currently using localforage to store data locally, however PhoneGap and Cordova don't seem to like this, so I will likely switch to a server side storage solution shortly.

I will also add some kind of login system so you can manage your collection across multiple devices and have it saved in the cloud.
